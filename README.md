# Fem Fylo Landing Page Challenge

## What I have learned?

### Key Points

- Structure Json Data Modal per component basis.
- Create Data Json data Modals only for dynamic data pieces.
- Never Use State to hold static data of any kind. Instead use a variable.
- Don't go too narrow while breaking down UI into Components(espacially if the data being used in that component is static)
- Implement learnings form the project during development phase, to the project itself, only in the maintanence phase.
